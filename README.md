# Alfred-Unicode-Math-Snippets
Latex is great when available. Sometimes it's not available like when you need to send a text message with an equation to someone real quick. For these cases I made this collection of unicode based mathematical text snippets for Alfred that allow crude equations to be easily typed. The resulting text can be copied and pasted into browsers and should work on most smart phones as well.
