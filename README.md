# Alfred-Unicode-Math-Snippets
Latex is great when available. Sometimes it's not available such as in situations where one would need to quickly send an equation to someone via text message. For these cases I made this collection of unicode based mathematical text snippets for Alfred that allow easy typing of crude equations with little learning curve. The resulting text can be copied and pasted into browsers and should work on most smart phones as well.
